## Assignment Details

- User Story
    AS AN employer
        I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
        SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.
- Acceptance Criteria
    GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:
- WHEN I load their portfolio
            THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
            THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
            THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
            THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
            THEN I am taken to that deployed application
 - WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
            THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description
- Header with name, photo and links to the information needed to contact. The profile image has CSS property sticky and flows with the scroll. 
- Navigation bar links lead to the information designed on the page. 
- The work section was created using CSS grids. The top application box is larger than the four applications below. User currently does not have any application or projects so the boxes do not lead to anything. The applications have the hover CSS property to add some more flair to the cards.
- The Git Hub Profile link leads user to author's git hub profile.
- The page is responsive with breakpoints of 1000ps, 768px and 576px.

- The CSS was created to flow with the HTML and is clean and concise. There is likely a lot of progress to be made to write cleaner code but it's a start. 
- The HTML was writted with clear semantics and heirarchy. 

- Below are images of the completed HTML and CSS code.
